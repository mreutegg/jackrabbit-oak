/**
 * Instances of this class represent the garbage collection generation related information
 * of a segment. Each generation consists of a full and a tail part and a tail flag.
 * The full and tail part are each increased by the respective garbage collection process.
 * In the tail compaction case the segments written by the compactor will also have their
 * tail flag set so cleanup can recognise them as not reclaimable (unless the full part is
 * older then the number of retained generations). Segments written by normal repository
 * writes will inherit the full and tail generations parts of the segments written by the
 * previous compaction process. However the tail flag is never set for such segments ensuring
 * cleanup after subsequent tail compactions can reclaim them once old enough (e.g. the tail
 * part of the generation is older then the number of retained generations).
